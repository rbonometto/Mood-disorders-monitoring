INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE DATABASE

Notes:
Some functionalities include queries which only consider the current date (ex. Daily Check, Upload data, etc).
Since no new data is actually generated and wearables aren't connected, data must be manually inserted into the tables to actually exploit the full functionalities. For example, if no data is present in the database for the patient in the current date, the Daily Check will still work but displaying empty boxes.
